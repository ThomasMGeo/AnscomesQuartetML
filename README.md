# AnscomesQuartetML
Small notebook comparing scikit-learn regression metrics on a classic dataset.


Anscombe's quartet is a great dataset to ponder when intrepreting summary stats. 

The wikipedia article is [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anscombe%27s_quartet) 
if you are not familiar with it. This is a single notebook, where I use some of the scikit-learn regression metrics to see the differences.
